# Nutrient Requirements of Conventionally and Organically Grown Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) in Eastern Canada

Canada is the second cranberry producer worldwide and the first in organic production. High berry yield and quality of sand-grown cranberry require proper nutrient management. The aim of this study was to measure the response of yield parameters, fruit yield, and berry quality of sand-grown cv. “Stevens” to mineral and organic fertilization in Eastern Canada. Replicated dosage of N, P, K, Mg, Cu, B, and S was varied in 2014, 2015, and 2016 at four sites. Berry count per upright, fruit set, and berry weight responded significantly (p < 0.05) to added N in 2014 and 2015. Berry yield could be predicted accurately from number of fruiting uprights, berry count per fruiting upright, number of reproductive uprights, and fruit set. In 2014-2016, there was no significant yield response to nutrients other than N except slight response to K beyond 40 Mg berry ha-1. Maximum yield was obtained at 45 kg N ha−1 in both conventionally and organically grown cranberries. Fish emulsions (6-1-1) and S‑coated urea tended to delay crop maturity compared to ammonium sulfate. Berry firmness, anthocyanin (TAcy) and soluble solids (Brix) decreased linearly with N additions, indicating a trade-off between berry yield and quality impacting growers’ decision on proper dosage.
